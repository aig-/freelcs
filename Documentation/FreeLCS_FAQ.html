    <ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>FreeLCS is a tool to automatically adjust loudness of audio files
        according to the EBU R128 recommendation.<br>
      </li>
      <li>EBU R128 is designed for professional broadcasters to help eliminate
        loudness jumps between broadcasted programs. Files adjusted according to
        R128 will at the same loudness level.</li>
      <li>FreeLCS is a Linux server that shares one of it's folders to the
        network.</li>
      <li>Users of your network can then drop audio files to the server for
        automatic loudness correction.</li>
      <li>For each processed file the server also creates a loudness history
        graphics file which shows loudness variations inside the file.</li>
      <li>FreeLCS is open source and free software. You don't have to pay
        anything to use it :)<br>
      </li>
      <li>FreeLCS site is here: <a href="http://freelcs.sourceforge.net/">http://freelcs.sourceforge.net/</a></li>

    <h2> <a id="What programs are used to process audio files ?">What programs
        are used to process audio files ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Natively supported formats are <strong>wav</strong>, <strong>flac</strong>
        and <strong>ogg</strong>. If <strong>libav-tools</strong> is installed
        then it's used to extract and convert audio from unsupported formats to
        wav and flac.<br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Mediainfo</strong> gets duration info from mpeg transport
        stream files.<br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>libebur128</strong> measures integrated and momentary loudness
        and maximum true peak value.</li>
      <li><strong>Sox</strong> adjusts file loudness to target level and also
        provides protective limiting in cases where it is needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Gnuplot</strong> creates loudness results graphics from
        momentary loudness calculations provided by libebur128.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><a id="What formats are supported ?">What formats are supported ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wav</strong>, <strong>flac</strong> and <strong>ogg</strong>
        are natively supported.</li>
      <li>If libav-tools is installed then it is used to convert other formats
        to supported formats before processing. Libav-tools supports a large
        number of formats: <strong>mp4</strong>, <strong>mp3</strong>, <strong>mp2</strong>,
        <strong>avi</strong>, <strong>mov</strong>, <strong>aac</strong>, <strong>h264</strong>,
        <strong>vob</strong>, <strong>mkv</strong> to name a few. Libav-tools
        is able to extract all audio streams from supported file types including
        video files. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Note that all channels of one mix must be in the same file. If your
        5.1 mix consists of 6 files, then you must combine them before dropping
        the mix into loudness correction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Libav-tools_vs_FFmpeg">Libav-tools vs. FFmpeg</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In 2011 a group of FFmpeg developers decided to take FFmpeg's source
        code and start a new project with it. The reason for this "fork" was the
        group was unhappy with the way the main FFmpeg developer managed the
        project. The group named the new project Libav and renamed the video
        and&nbsp; audio conversion program from <strong>ffmpeg</strong> to <strong>avconv</strong>.
        This "fork" created a new project that continued development of the
        FFmpeg source code parallel to the FFmpeg - project. Both projects have
        slowly evolved their own way creating a puzzling situation for the
        users. Tools that both projects develop (FFmpeg and avconv) are quite
        similar by features, but there are differences in capabilites and usage
        here and there. More about the FFmpeg vs. libav situation can be read <a
          href="http://blog.pkh.me/p/13-the-ffmpeg-libav-situation.html">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Ubuntu 14.04 no longer has FFmpeg available in the package repository,
        only libav is available for easy installation. Because of this FreeLCS
        2.5 now only supports libav (for all supported operating systems Debian
        7, Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Libav-tools / FFmpeg and patents">Avconv / FFmpeg and patents</a><br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Most audio post production is done in <strong>Wav</strong> format
        because it is very widely supported and can be used without paying
        license fees for the use of the format (source: <a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000025.shtml">http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000025.shtml</a>,&nbsp;
        <a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000001.shtml">http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000001.shtml</a>).
        FreeLCS supports wav and two royalty / patent free formats <strong>flac</strong>
        and <strong>ogg </strong>(license: <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/license.html">http://flac.sourceforge.net/license.html</a>).
        If your production is done in wav then you don't ever need to install
        libav-tools.</li>
      <li>Avconv is a video and audio conversion tool that can be used to
        convert media to many different formats. Using avconv to decompress
        audio from patented formats may require a license from the rights
        holders. However avconv may also be used to process free formats (MXF,
        MKV, WebM and others) or formats with possibly expired patents (Mpeg1
        Layer1, Mpeg 1 Layer2) without acquiring licenses (source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-1#Patents">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-1#Patents</a>).
        To more complicate things some patented formats may be patented in some
        countries but not in others. Also the expiration dates for these patents
        may vary between countries.</li>
      <li>FreeLCS uses avconv from the libav-tools package if it's installed but
        works fine without it with wav, flac and ogg formats.<br>
      </li>

    <h2><a id="Can_I_restrict_avconv_/_FFmpeg_to_use_only_patent_free_formats">Can
        I restrict avconv / FFmpeg to use only patent free formats</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Yes, in FreeLCS 2.5 you can set avconv / FFmpeg allowed formats during
        installation. In the following picture below allowed wrapper formats are
        restricted to:&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>wav</strong>, <strong>flac</strong>
        <strong>ogg</strong>, <strong>matroska</strong> &nbsp; and allowed codec
        formats are restricted to: &nbsp; <strong>pcm</strong>, <strong>flac</strong>,
        <strong>vorbis</strong>.</li>

    <h2> <a id="How many audio streams in a file are supported ?">How many
        audio streams in a file are supported ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When libav-tools is not installed: 1 audio stream.<br>
      </li>
      <li>When libav-tools is installed: the limit for the number of audio
        streams in a single file has not been tested. I personally have tested
        files with 16 streams with no problems. Upper limit is propably set by a
        possible limit in libav-tools or file format in question.<br>

    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2> <a id="What is the maximum / minimum file duration supported ?">What
        is the maximum / minimum file duration supported ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The shortest supported file duration is exactly 1 second.</li>
      <li>The longest supported file duration should in theory be unlimited, but
        no tests have been made to find out the limit.</li>
      <li>The longest real world file I have tested was 18 hours of 16 bit
        Stereo Mpeg 1 Layer 2 compressed audio from television
        transmission.&nbsp; The longest test files (with only 1 kHz sine wave)
        were 33 hours of Flac compressed 24 bit stereo audio and 388 hours of
        ogg vorbis compresses stereo audio. The last one is 16 days of
        continuous audio and the loudness corrected version was a 51 GB flac -
        compressed file :)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><a id="What is the output format of FreeLCS ?">What is the output format
        of FreeLCS ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>FreeLCS output format is wav if output file size does not exceed wav
        format max size 4 GB. In case of very large files the output format is
        flac. See also question: <a href="#What%20happens%20if%20output%20file%20size%20exceeds%20wav%20format%204%20GB%20size%20limit%20?">What
          happens if output file size exceeds wav format 4 GB size limit ?</a><br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><a id="What happens to the files when they are processed ?">What happens
        to the files when they are processed ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>First incoming files are searched for supported audio streams.</li>
      <li>FreeLCS natively supports wav, flac and ogg formats and one audio
        stream per file. If there are more streams or the audio format is
        unsupported then libav-tools is used (only if libav-tools is installed)
        to convert streams to a supported format.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Libav-tools places extracted streams back to FreeLCS HotFolder so that
        they are seen as new files coming into processing. When all streams have
        been extracted then the original file is deleted as it is no longer
        needed.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Then two simultaneous loudness calculation processes are started for
        the file. One measures integrated loudness and the other momentary
        loudness. Momentary loudness is calculated in 3 second slices for files
        longer than 12 seconds and in 0.5 seconds slices for files shorter than
        that. </li>
      <li>After loudness measurement Gnuplot creates a loudness result graphics
        file from momentary loudness measurements provided by libebur128.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Then a new loudness adjusted file is created with sox. Loudness of
        this file is at EBU R128 target level <strong>-23.0 LUFS</strong>.</li>
      <li>All files will be automatically deleted after a delay defined during
        FreeLCS installation, default is 8 hours.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Is TruePeak measurement supported ?">Is TruePeak measurement
        supported ?</a></h2>
    <p>Yes :) When you install the software you can choose which method of peak
      measurement is used: sample peak or TruePeak.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Is peak limiting used when loudness correction adjusts volume up ?">Is
        peak limiting used when loudness correction adjusts volume up ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If file gain is adjusted down then no peak limiting is needed as the
        peaks also go down.</li>
      <li>If file gain must be adjusted up then a protective limiter is used but
        only if peaks would go over a set limit after gain correction.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The max peaks after gain adjustment will be at -3 dBFS when using
        sample peaks and -1 dBTP when using TruePeak.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="What happens to the internal dynamics of a processed file ?">What
        happens to the internal dynamics of a processed file ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The dynamics inside an audio file are not changed in any way, only the
        gain of the whole file is adjusted up or down so that the average
        loudness of file hits -23.0 LUFS. For example if measured file loudness
        is at -20.0 LUFS, then all samples of the file will be adjusted down by
        3 dBs when loudness corrected file is created.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><a id="What channel orders are supported ?">What channel orders are
        supported ?</a></h2>
    The following channel orders are supported:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>1.0 = Mono</li>
      <li>2.0 = L, R.<br>
      </li>
      <li>3.0 = Any channel order for front channels L, R, C.</li>
      <li>4.0 = L, R, LS, RS.</li>
      <li>5.0 = L, R, C, LS, RS.</li>
      <li>5.1 = L, R, C, LFE, LS, RS.</li>
    </ul>
    Ebu R128 recommendation (or to be more precise ITU 1770 that R128 refers to)
    does not support any specific channel order, it only defines how loudness
    measurement of: <strong>Front</strong>, <strong>Surround</strong> and <strong>LFE</strong>
    channels differs from each other. Surround channels are weighted differently
    from front channels and LFE channel is always discarded from loudness
    calculation. This means that for example in the case of 3.0 any channel
    order is supported since all of the channels L, R, C are front channels and
    weighted equally in loudness calculation.<br>
    <p><strong>Important notes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Channel counts of more than six channels are not supported and not
        processed !!!!!!!</li>
      <li>All channels of one mix must be in the same file. If your 5.1 mix
        consists of 6 files, then you must combine them before dropping the mix
        into loudness correction.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><a id="What is the calculation precision ?">What is the calculation
        precision ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Audio gain adjustment is done with sox and it uses 32 bits by default
        for all calculations.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If output file bit depth is not 32 bits, then sox uses dithering by
        default. The output file has the same bit depth as the input file in
        most cases.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><a id="Is bit depth and sample rate preserved ?">Is bit depth and sample
        rate preserved ?</a></h2>
    Sample rate should be preserved in all cases. <br>
    <br>
    The following rules for bit depth conversion comes from internal limitations
    in sox and libav-tools.<br>
    <br>
    <u><strong>When </strong></u><u><strong>libav-tools is not installed:</strong></u><br>
    <ul>
      <li>64 bit audio is not supported.</li>
      <li>If audio is in uncompressed PCM - format, then bit depth is preserved.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If audio has been compressed with ogg then the audio has no real bit
        depth anymore and audio will be extracted using bit depth of 16 bits.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If audio is in flac format then bit depth is preserved except that 8
        bit audio is converted to 16 bits. Flac supports bit depths up to 24
        bits.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <u><strong>When </strong></u><u><strong>libav-tools is installed:</strong></u><br>
    <ul>
      <li>If audio is in uncompressed PCM - format, then bit depth is preserved
        except that 64 bit audio will be converted to 32 bits because sox
        supports bit depths only up to 32 bits.</li>
      <li>If audio has been compressed using a lossy codec then the audio has no
        real bit depth anymore and audio will be extracted using 16 bits.</li>
      <li>If output file size exceeds 4 GBs then FreeLCS must store the audio in
        flac format when processing it. Bit depths bigger than 16 will be
        converted to 16 bits on <strong>Ubuntu 12.04</strong> and <strong>Debian
          7</strong>. This is caused by an internal limitation in libav-tools
        version distributed with Ubuntu 12.04 and Debian 7, it always uses 16
        bits when storing in flac format. Ubuntu 14.04 ships with a new version
        of libav-tools that is able to store 24 bit flac files. Bit depths
        bigger than 24 will be converted to 24 bits. 8 bit audio will be
        converted to 16 bits on all supported platforms if output file size
        exceeds 4 GB.</li>
    </ul>
    <u><strong></strong></u><br>
    <h2><a id="What happens if output file size exceeds wav format 4 GB size limit ?">What
        happens if output file size exceeds wav format 4 GB size limit ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Audio production is usually done in wav format since wav is so widely
        supported. The wav format has a max supported file size of 4 GB.</li>
      <li>If the output file size would exceed this hard limit then FreeLCS
        splits audio channels in the file to separate wav - files. If the size
        of a separate channel would also go over the 4 GB limit then FreeLCS
        saves all channels of the file in a single flac file. Flac - format
        supports very large files.</li>
      <li>There are new revisions of the wav format (RF64, W64) that can store
        files larger than 4 GB, but I have not tested these formats.&nbsp; RF64
        and W64 are not yet very widely supported.<br>
      </li>

        FreeLCS remux loudness corrected audio back to the video it was
        extracted from ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No. FreeLCS tries to extract and process all audio streams from the
        video file, but it won't remux video and audio back together.</li>

    <h2><a id="Is MXF supported ?">Is MXF supported ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Libav-tools supports MXF and I've been able to extract audio from MXF
        - wrapped files with it. FreeLCS 2.5 allows the user to define MXF audio
        remix maps that define how audio is to be recombined to different mixes
        before loudness processing. However MXF is not one format, but a family
        of formats. Every hardware and software vendor seem to have their own
        version of it. MXF files created with one device might not be compatible
        with a device created by another vendor. Because of this there is no
        guarantee that FreeLCS can process every MXF - file you feed it. It
        might be a good idea to do a thorough test with a large set of different
        MXF files before you make this feature part of your workflow. More about
        MXF Audio Remixing can be found in the <a href="Machine_readable_results_and_MXF_audio_remix_mapping.html#MXF_audio_remixing">user

    <br>
    LTS stands for <strong>L</strong>ong <strong>T</strong>erm <strong>S</strong>upport.
    Ubuntu LTS releases get security updates for 5 years from the first release
    date. <strong>Ubuntu 12.04 LTS</strong> will get security updates until
    April 2017 and <strong>Ubuntu 14.04 LTS </strong>until April 2019.<br>
    <br>
    Canonical releases a new Ubuntu LTS version every 2 years. If you install
    FreeLCS on Ubuntu 12.04 then you will need to upgrade the software not
    sooner than 2017. The supported version of Ubuntu at that time will be
    Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

    <h2><a id="FreeLCS_error_messages" name="FreeLCS_error_messages"></a>FreeLCS
      error messages</h2>
    <p>If you enable FreeLCS to send error messages by email, then you probably
      sometimes get some messages that at first might seem puzzling. Here are
      the explanations :)</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Critical_error_messages">Critical error messages</a></h2>
    <h3><span class="il">LoudnessCorrection</span> has stopped updating
      timestamps</h3>
    <p>If you get the following error message, then it means that FreeLCS has
      encountered an error that it can not recover from and has stopped. FreeLCS
      starts jobs in threads that periodically writes timestamps to a file. The
      script "HeartBeat_Checker.py" watches this file and sends you email if one
      or more timestamps stop updating. This means that a thread has crashed and
      you need to restart FreeLCS to restore normal operation. You can restart
      FreeLCS either by rebooting the computer or giving this command as root on
      the commandline:</p>
    <p><strong>/etc/init.d/loudnesscorrection_init_script restart</strong></p>
    Note that it takes about 2 minutes for the service to start. This delay has
    been put in because it takes some time before all Linux services are
    available when the computer starts up.<strong><br>
      <br>
    </strong><br>
    I have worked very hard to make FreeLCS solid as a rock. My goal is to keep
    it 100% reliable, so that it can be used in business environments. So you
    should never see this message :) but with computers anything is possible :)
    For example a failing hard disk may corrupt FreeLCS installation.<br>

    <h3>Error deleting files queued for deletion</h3>
    <p>You may see this error message with if you mount FreeLCS HotFolder with
      the NFS protocol. This error happens when a user uses a program that
      creates a file on the FreeLCS disk and then unlinks it.</p>

      Linux keeps this file available to the user while hiding the file from
      others. The file is renamed with a name that starts with a dot and Linux
      filesystem hides these files from file listings by default.</p>
    <p>The hidden file will disappear when the user closes the program that
