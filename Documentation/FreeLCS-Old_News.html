    <h2><strong>Old news:</strong> </h2>
    <strong>2012.10.11</strong> FreeLCS 2.1 released.
    <ul>
      <li>This release fixes a bug: bit depth was not preserved if input file
        had many audio streams with uncompressed audio in it.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>2012.10.01:</strong> FreeLCS 2.0 released :)
    <ul>
      <li>This is an important bug fix release and everybody should upgrade.</li>
      <li>Fixes a large number of bugs and undesired behaviors in FreeLCS and
        includes several enhancements.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixes a couple of problems in helper programs libebur128 and sox. The
        sox version 14.3.2 that comes with Ubuntu 12.04 is not able to handle
        bigger than 4 GB files correctly. FreeLCS installer now downloads sox
        source code and compiles and installs version 14.4.0 that fixes the
        problem.</li>
      <li>Supported channel orders are now defined (<a href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#What%20channel%20orders%20are%20supported%20?">see
          FAQ</a>).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Libebur128 is patched to support channel orders: 4.0 (L, R, LS, RS)
        and 5.0 (L, R, C, LFE, LS, RS). These were previously not supported.</li>
      <li>Libebur128 developer fixed a bug that caused loudness calculation to
        hang when processing lots of very short files.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Behaviour for files bigger than 4 GB is now defined (<a href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#What%20happens%20if%20output%20file%20size%20exceeds%20wav%20format%204%20GB%20size%20limit%20?">see
          FAQ</a>).</li>
      <li>Complete log of all changes is in the <a href="Changelog.txt">changelog</a>.<a
          href="file:///home/mika/freelcs/Documentation/Changelog.txt"></a></li>
