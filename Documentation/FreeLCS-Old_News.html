    <h2><strong>Old news:</strong> </h2>
    <strong>2013.03.10 FreeLCS 2.2 released.<br>
    </strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong></strong>This is a maintenance bug fix release. This version
        fixes a couple of bugs that sometimes caused file processing to hang.
        This release also adds code that catches possible Python error messages
        and sends them to the user. This helps to identify what situation caused
        the error.</li>
      <li>Addition to the manual "How to synchronize server clock to a NTP
        server".</li>
      <li>Correction to manual: "Use UUID as the device name when configuring
        software raid". This solves the problem where raid device number
        sometimes changes when a kernel update is installed.</li>
      <li>The installer no longer installs FFmpeg, but if the user does, then
        FFmpeg is used for file processing.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>2012.10.11</strong> FreeLCS 2.1 released.
    <ul>
      <li>This release fixes a bug: bit depth was not preserved if input file
        had many audio streams with uncompressed audio in it.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>2012.10.01:</strong> FreeLCS 2.0 released :)
    <ul>
      <li>This is an important bug fix release and everybody should upgrade.</li>
      <li>Fixes a large number of bugs and undesired behaviors in FreeLCS and
        includes several enhancements.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixes a couple of problems in helper programs libebur128 and sox. The
        sox version 14.3.2 that comes with Ubuntu 12.04 is not able to handle
        bigger than 4 GB files correctly. FreeLCS installer now downloads sox
        source code and compiles and installs version 14.4.0 that fixes the
        problem.</li>
      <li>Supported channel orders are now defined (<a href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#What%20channel%20orders%20are%20supported%20?">see
          FAQ</a>).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Libebur128 is patched to support channel orders: 4.0 (L, R, LS, RS)
        and 5.0 (L, R, C, LFE, LS, RS). These were previously not supported.</li>
      <li>Libebur128 developer fixed a bug that caused loudness calculation to
        hang when processing lots of very short files.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Behaviour for files bigger than 4 GB is now defined (<a href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#What%20happens%20if%20output%20file%20size%20exceeds%20wav%20format%204%20GB%20size%20limit%20?">see
          FAQ</a>).</li>
      <li>Complete log of all changes is in the <a href="Changelog.txt">changelog</a>.<a
          href="file:///home/mika/freelcs/Documentation/Changelog.txt"></a></li>
    </ul>
