    <br>
    FreeLCS stands for <strong>Free Loudness Correction Server</strong>.
    FreeLCS lets you automatically correct audio files to EBU R128 target
    loudness level.<br>
    <br>
    The software lets you easily set up a server that shares one of it's folders
    to the network. Users of your network can then drop audio files to the
    server for automatic loudness correction. For each processed file the server
    also creates a loudness history graphics file which shows loudness
    variations inside the file.<br>
    <br>
    The software is very fast even on modest hardware giving 15 times faster
    than realtime processing (16 bit stereo files, TruePeak measurement turned
    on) on a server with one Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 2 GB Ram, 3 internal
    Sata disks in software RAID 0.<br>
    <br>
    FreeLCS uses other open source programs to get the job done (Linux,
    libebur128, gnuplot, libav-tools (optional), sox, mediainfo). All software
    is free and Open Source.<br>

    <h1><strong>Latest news:</strong></h1>
    <h4>2014.06.05 FreeLCS 3.0 released.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>This new release adds major new features. If you are happy with your
        current FreeLCS 2.3 or 2.4 installation then there is no reason to
        upgrade :)</li>
      <li>Support for Debian 7, Ubuntu 12.04 Server, Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop and
        Server added. Note that installation on <a href="Debian_modifications_needed_before_FreeLCS_installation.html">Debian
          7</a> and <a href="Ubuntu_Server_modifications_needed_before_FreeLCS_installation.html">Ubuntu
          Server</a> requires some modifications to the operating system
        configuration before installation.</li>
      <li>FreeLCS 3.0 is able to <a href="Machine_readable_results_and_MXF_audio_remix_mapping.html#Machine_readable_results">write
          loudness results to a machine readable file</a>. With this feature you
        can make FreeLCS the loudness measurement step in your automated file
        processing workflow. You can also configure FreeLCS not to produce any
        output files (loudness corrected audio files, history graphics) since
        these might not be needed in an automated workflow.</li>
      <li>With FreeLCS 3.0 you can define how audio channels inside an MXF file
        will be combined to new mixes before loudness processing. The feature is
        called <a href="Machine_readable_results_and_MXF_audio_remix_mapping.html#MXF_audio_remixing">MXF
          audio remixing</a>.</li>
      <li>FreeLCS is no longer tested with FFmpeg since FFmpeg is no longer
        easily available in Ubuntu 14.04 repositories. The only common tool
        easily avaible to Debian 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 users is avconv
        from libav-tools. FreeLCS 3.0 uses avconv if it is installed by the
        user. There is a small known problem with the avconv version that ships
        with Ubuntu 14.04 , <a href="known_problems.txt">read about it here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2013.12.04 FreeLCS 2.4 released.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Libebur128 source code repository that FreeLCS uses during
        installation was reorganized by its author. The change broke
        installation for FreeLCS 2.3 and older. I uploaded my backup of original
        libebur128 source code to github and updated FreeLCS installer to
        install libebur128 from this new repository.</li>
      <li>All installations made before this change will continue to work fine,
        but new installations or restoring an old backup made with FreeLCS 2.3
        backup-tool won't work anymore. All new installations must be done with
        version 2.4. Sorry for the inconvenience.</li>
      <li>If you made a backup of your server using the tool provided in FreeLCS
        2.3 zip, then please download FreeLCS version 2.4 and make a new backup.
        The restore script in version 2.3 uses the original libebur128
        repository and it does not work the way it used to when FreeLCS 2.3 was
        released.</li>
      <li>There is no new functionality in this release (though some new
        features are under development :)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4> <strong>2013.03.29</strong> FreeLCS 2.3 released.</h4>
    <h4> </h4>
    <ul>
      <li> This is a maintenance bug fix release.</li>
      <li>Fixes a bug made in FreeLCS version 2.2 that affects only output files
        bigger than 4 GB. When the output file was split to separate mono
        channels, some channels were missing.</li>
      <li>Fixed a number of ways LoudnessCorrection.py could be crashed by
        deleting files that it was already processing.</li>
      <li>Added a new script to backup / clone FreeLCS installation to another
        Ubuntu machine. The script does not require X and can be used over a ssh
        - connection. This functionality can be used to create automation that
        clones FreeLCS installation to several machines quickly and easily. Read
        about it <a href="FreeLCS_User_Manual.html#Cloning%20a%20FreeLCS%20installation%20to%20another%20machine%20%28without%20a%20display%29">here</a>.

    </ul>
    <h4>2013.03.11 <span style="font-weight: normal;">Released introductory
        material about EBU R128 recommendation and FreeLCS. This version is in
        Finnish language only. The material tries to explain R128 concepts and
        FreeLCS usage in the point of view of a common user.&nbsp; Read it here:
