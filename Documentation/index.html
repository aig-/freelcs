    <h1>FreeLCS</h1>
    <br>
    FreeLCS stands for <strong>Free Loudness Correction Server</strong>. The
    software lets you easily set up a server that shares one of it's folders to
    the network where users can drop audio files to be loudness corrected
    according to the EBU R128 loudness standard. The server also creates a
    loudness history graphics file which gives visual feedback of the internal
    loudness variations in a file.<br>
    <br>
    The software is very fast even on modest hardware giving 20 times faster
    than realtime processing on a server with one Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 2
    GB Ram, 3 internal Sata disks in software RAID 0. <br>
    <br>
    FreeLCS uses other open source programs to get the job done (Linux,
    libebur128, gnuplot, FFmpeg, sox).<br>

    <h3><strong>News:</strong></h3>
    <strong>2012.07.08:</strong> First public release of FreeLCS 1.00.<br>
    <br>
    <h2> <a id="Features">Features</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Calculates loudness according to EBU R128 for files dropped into the
        HotFolder.</li>
      <li>For each file it creates an loudness history graphics file which gives
        visual feedback of the loudness variations in the file.</li>
      <li>Creates loudness corrected versions of each file dropped in the
        servers HotFolder.</li>
      <li>Uses FFmpeg to pre-process files and supports the huge number of file
        formats FFmpeg supports.<br>
      </li>
      <li> Supports files with several audio streams. Each stream is demuxed to
        a separate file and loudness corrected.</li>
      <li>Even video files can dropped in for processing. Audio streams are
        demuxed from the file and processed.<br>
      </li>
      <li> Supports channel counts from mono to 5.1.</li>
      <li> Takes advantage of multiple processor cores to run calculations
        simultaneously.</li>
      <li>Uses a protective limiter to prevent clipping in cases where volume
        must be increased.<br>
      </li>
      <li> Automatic file deletion after a set time.</li>
      <li>Possible error messages are emailed to the admin.</li>
      <li>All software is free and Open Source.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Very easy to use, just drop in your file and copy back the corrected
        version.</li>
      <li>Easy to integrate in many workflows.</li>
      <li>Modest hardware requirements.</li>
      <li>Written in Python 3.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
