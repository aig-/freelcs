    <h1>FreeLCS</h1>
    <br>
    FreeLCS stands for <strong>Free Loudness Correction Server</strong>. The
    software lets you easily set up a server that shares one of it's folders to
    the network where users can drop audio files to be loudness corrected
    according to the EBU R128 loudness recommendation. The server also creates a
    loudness history graphics file which gives visual feedback of the internal
    loudness variations in a file.<br>
    <br>
    The software is very fast even on modest hardware giving 15 times faster
    than realtime processing (16 bit stereo files, TruePeak measurement turned
    on) on a server with one Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 2 GB Ram, 3 internal
    Sata disks in software RAID 0. <br>
    <br>
    FreeLCS uses other open source programs to get the job done (Linux,
    libebur128, gnuplot, FFmpeg, sox, mediainfo).<br>
    <h2><strong>Latest news:</strong></h2>
    <h2>2013.12.04 FreeLCS 2.4 released.</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Libebur128 source code repository that FreeLCS uses during
        installation was reorganized by its author. The change broke
        installation for FreeLCS 2.3 and older. I uploaded my backup of original
        libebur128 source code to github and updated FreeLCS installer to
        install libebur128 from this new repository.</li>
      <li>All installations made before this change will continue to work fine,
        but new installations or restoring an old backup made with FreeLCS 2.3
        backup-tool won't work anymore. All new installations must be done with
        version 2.4. Sorry for the inconvenience.</li>
      <li>If you made a backup of your server using the tool provided in FreeLCS
        2.3 zip, then please download FreeLCS version 2.4 and make a new backup.
        The restore script in version 2.3 uses the original libebur128
        repository and it does not work the way it used to when FreeLCS 2.3 was
        released.</li>
      <li>There is no new functionality in this release (though some new
        features are under development :)</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>2013.03.29</strong> FreeLCS 2.3 released.<br>
    <ul>
      <li> This is a maintenance bug fix release.</li>
      <li>Fixes a bug made in FreeLCS version 2.2 that affects only output files
        bigger than 4 GB. When the output file was split to separate mono
        channels, some channels were missing.</li>
      <li>Fixed a number of ways LoudnessCorrection.py could be crashed by
        deleting files that it was already processing.</li>
      <li>Added a new script to backup / clone FreeLCS installation to another
        Ubuntu machine. The script does not require X and can be used over a ssh
        - connection. This functionality can be used to create automation that
        clones FreeLCS installation to several machines quickly and easily. Read
        about it <a href="FreeLCS_User_Manual.html#Cloning%20a%20FreeLCS%20installation%20to%20another%20machine%20%28without%20a%20display%29">here</a>.

    <h4>2013.03.11 <span style="font-weight: normal;">Released introductory
        material about EBU R128 recommendation and FreeLCS. This version is in
        Finnish language only, a English version will follow when I get the
        translation ready. The material tries to explain R128 concepts and
        FreeLCS usage in the point of view of a common user.&nbsp; Read it here:

    <p><strong>2013.03.10</strong> FreeLCS 2.2 released.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This is a maintenance bug fix release. This version fixes a couple of
        bugs that sometimes caused file processing to hang. This release also
        adds code that catches possible Python error messages and sends them to
        the user. This helps to identify what situation caused the error.<br>

      <li>Addition to the manual "<a href="FreeLCS_User_Manual.html#Synchronizing%20clock%20to%20a%20NTP%20time%20server">How
          to synchronize server clock to a NTP server</a>".</li>
      <li>Correction to manual: "<a href="FreeLCS_User_Manual.html#Configuring%20software%20Raid">Use
          UUID as the device name when configuring software raid</a>". This
        solves the problem where raid device number sometimes changes when a
        kernel update is installed.<br>

      <li><a href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#What%20formats%20are%20supported%20?">The
          installer no longer installs FFmpeg</a>, but if the user does, then
        FFmpeg is used for file processing.</li>

    <h2> <a id="Features">Features</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Calculates loudness according to EBU R128 for files dropped into the
        HotFolder.</li>
      <li>For each file it creates a loudness history graphics file which gives
        visual feedback of the loudness variations in the file.</li>
      <li>Creates loudness corrected versions of each file dropped in the
        servers HotFolder.</li>

        formats FFmpeg supports.<br>
      </li>

        a separate file and loudness corrected.</li>
      <li>Even video files can be dropped in for processing. Audio streams are
        demuxed from the file and processed.<br>
      </li>
      <li> Supports channel counts from mono to 5.1.</li>
      <li> Takes advantage of multiple processor cores to run calculations
