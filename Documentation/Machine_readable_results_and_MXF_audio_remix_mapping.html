    <h2><a id="Machine_readable_results">Machine readable results</a></h2>
    <p>FreeLCS 2.5 lets you define how it outputs its results. Most users will
      want the old behavior from FreeLCS version up to 2.4 that is: create a
      loudness corrected audio file, a history graphics file and delete
      multistream files immediately after all audiostreams have been extracted
      to individual files (multistream extraction requires the installation of
      libav-tools). This behaviour is achieved by setting <strong>"Yes"</strong>&nbsp;
      in "<strong>Use FreeLCS file output defaults</strong>".</p>
    <p>If you would like to integrate FreeLCS as a loudness measurement step in
      your automated workflow, then you might want to change the defaults.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <img alt="" src="Pictures/Installation-17.jpg"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    When you set "<strong>Use FreeLCS file output defaults</strong>" to "<strong>No</strong>",
    then you can change settings for the output files.<br>
    <br>
    If your FreeLCS - machine is the loudness measurement step in an automated
    workflow, then you might want to disable some output file creation. You can
    prevent creation of loudness corrected files and history graphics files. You
    can also prevent FreeLCS from deleting multistream input files after audio
    extraction if you need the original file to remain on the disk for further
    processing.<br>
    <br>
    FreeLCS 2.5 is also able to output loudness measurement results in a machine
    readable file. You might want this if some other device needs to read in
    loudness measurement results to make a decision about how the file is
    processed further.<br>

    <h2><a id="Separator_characters_in_the_machine_readable_results_file">Separator
        characters in the machine readable results file</a></h2>
    <p>One input file can hold many audio streams in it and FreeLCS splits these
      streams to individual files for loudness processing (if libav-tools is
      installed). So a single input file can result in many output files whose
      loudness is individually measured. Because of this the machine readable
      results file may consist of loudness results of many audio files. </p>
    <p>The results for a single file needs to be separated by a known character
      or group of characters so that it is easy for a machine to know which
      value is the integrated loudness result and which is the LRA result and so
      on. In addition to this if the input file was split to many output files,
      then we need to separate the results for individual files with a known
      character or group of characters.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The separator characters must be chosen so that they can never appear in
      a file name. If our separator character happens to be part of a file name,
      then the machine trying to interpret our results will split the filename
      at this character and the values following the split will be interpreted
      incorrectly.</p>
    <p>This problem has been solved when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII
        character set</a> was designed. The designers assigned two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter#ASCII_delimited_text">characters
        for this job</a>: <strong>ASCII character 31</strong> is meant for
      separating different values from each other and <strong>ASCII character
        30</strong> is meant for separating different sets of data from each
      other. Character 31 is called <strong>Unit Separator</strong> and
      character 30 is called the <strong>Record Separator</strong>. The
      operating system don't allow users to use these characters in file names,
      so these characters are safe to use as data separator characters.</p>
    <p>The machine readable results file is only a text file with the loudness
      measurement values in it separated by know characters. However there might
      sometimes be reason for a person to open a machine readable results file
      in a text editor to check the values inside it. This is not possible if
      the ASCII character 30 is used as the separator for results for different
      files. In this case the user sees the results as one big line of text
      because the text editor is not clever enough to split results for
      different files to separate lines of text. This is why I chose to use the
      windows line feed string (ASCII character 13 followed with character 10)
      as the default record separator. When this record separator is used, then
      a machine readable results file becomes much more readable when opened in
      a text editor, because the editor splits the results for individual files
      as separate lines of text.</p>
    <p>However you can select any non printable ASCII character as the unit and
      record separator. You can use 1 or 2 character strings for each.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Machine_readable_results_file_format">Machine readable results
        file format</a></h2>
    <p>The machine readable results file name is always:&nbsp;<strong>
        InputFileName-machine_readable_results.txt</strong></p>
    <p>Example: Input file name is:&nbsp; <strong>Euroviisut-2007-Final.mp4</strong></p>
    <p>Machine readable results file name is:&nbsp; <strong>Euroviisut-2007-Final.mp4-machine_readable_results.txt</strong></p>
    <p>This means that if you know the name of the input file, you can get the
      machine readable results file name just by appending "<strong>-machine_readable_results.txt</strong>"
      to it.<br>
      <strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong><br>
      </strong></p>
    <p>A machine readable results file always has information about all audio
      streams of the input file. Values for one output file are separated with
      the unit separator string and the record separator string is used when
      results for one ouput file ends and results for another starts. Unit and
      record separator strings are both defined during FreeLCS installation.</p>

      <br>
      <strong>0</strong> = No Errors<br>
      <strong>1</strong> = Loudness is below measurement threshold (-70 LUFS)<br>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Item 0:</strong> The number of the mix. If there are many
        audio streams in the input file, then this number tells you which one of
        these streams this mix is.</li>
      <li><strong>Item 1</strong>: Total number of supported streams in the
        input file. There can be both unsupported and supported streams in a
        input file. FreeLCS is not able to process unsupported streams. This
        value tells you how many streams FreeLCS is able to process from the
        input file.</li>
      <li><strong>Item 2</strong>: Total number of streams in the input file.
        This number contains both the unsupported and supported streams in a
        input file.</li>
      <li><strong>Item 3</strong>: Create Loudness Corrected Files (True /
        False). The value tells you if the user has instructed FreeLCS to create
        loudness corrected files or not (this is set during FreeLCS
        installation). If this is "False" then FreeLCS will not produce loudness
        corrected audio files.</li>
      <li><strong>Item 4</strong>: Number of files in this mix. This tells you
        how many audio files this mix resulted to. This number is always 1
        except in two cases. It is 0 when an error happened and FreeLCS was not
        able to process the file. In this case this number tells you that there
        are zero resulting output files.&nbsp; The other case when this value
        differs from 0 is when the output file size is so big that FreeLCS needs
        to split the file to one file per audio channel. In this case this
        number tells you the number of audio files the mix was split into. The
        items from number 14-&gt; will tell you the names of output files.</li>

      05 - 11:</strong><br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Item 5</strong>: Integrated Loudness of the uncorrected input
        file. If loudness is below measurement threshhold, then this value is
        'inf'.</li>
      <li> <strong>Item 6</strong>: Loudness Range of the uncorrected input
        file.</li>
      <li> <strong>Item 7</strong>: Highest Peak of the uncorrected input file
        (dBFS or dBTP depending what user selected during installation).</li>

        you how many channels there are in this mix.</li>
      <li> <strong>Item 9</strong>: Sample Rate.</li>
      <li> <strong>Item 10</strong>: Bit Depth.</li>

    <strong style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Items</strong>
      12 - 13:</strong><br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Item 12:</strong> This value holds possible error codes. If
        this value is 0 then FreeLCS successfully processed the stream,
        otherwise processing failed and there will be no loudness calculation
        results nor loudness corrected files for this stream. Error code <strong>9</strong>
        means that in addition of supported files, there are some audio files
        inside the MXF wrapper that FreeLCS is not able to process. When MXF
        audio remixing feature is on, then this situation may produce unexpected
        results meaning that audio channel inside the MXF file might be combined
        in ways that the user did not anticipate. MXF audio remixing works
        correctly only when FreeLCS is able to process all files inside the MXF
        wrapper. Other error codes are explained above.</li>
      <li><strong>Item 13:</strong> This item is the error message text. If
        there is no error then this item is empty. </li>

      14:</strong><br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Item 14:</strong> The items from number 14-&gt; will tell you
        the names of output files. If the output file has been split to one file
        per audio channel, then here are all the output file names separated by
        the unit separator.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Record Separator:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>This is by default ASCII characters 13 and 10. When you encounter this
        string in the machine readable results file it means that values for one
        input stream ends here and values for the next stream starts.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Example 1:</h3>
    FreeLCS has processed a input file that has only one audio stream in it. It
    is a wav file named: <strong>Test_File-01.wav</strong>&nbsp; The machine
    readable results file name is:&nbsp; <strong>Test_File-01.wav-machine_readable_results.txt</strong><br>
    <br>
    The values inside the machine readable results file are below. Note that I
    have changed the unit separator character to comma here to make the text
    more human readable :)<br>
    <br>
    <strong style="font-family: monospace;">1, 1, 1, True, 1, -22.9, 12.2, -6.7,
      2, 48000, 16, 3070, 0,&nbsp; , Test_File-01_-23_LUFS.wav</strong><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    If you want a machine to interpret the values inside the machine readable
    file, then you first must check the item <strong>12</strong>. If it is non
    zero, then an error happened and there are no loudness calculation results
    to read. The error number tells you what the the error was and the error
    message text is located in value <strong>13</strong>. If item <strong>12</strong>
    is zero, then FreeLCS successfully processed the file. Then you must check
    item <strong>1</strong> because it tells you how many output files resulted
    from the input file. This item tells you how many loudness results you need
    to read (one set of results for each output file). In this case there is
    only 1 output file. Now you can read in the loudness measurement results
    from items numbered 5 - 7.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Example 2:</h3>
    FreeLCS has processed a transport stream file that had 14 audio streams in
    it. All streams were first saved to separate files and then went through
    loudness processing.<br>
    <br>
    The input file name was:&nbsp; <strong>20120712-2000-0000091191.mpg</strong>&nbsp;
    and the machine readable results file name was:&nbsp; <strong>20120712-2000-0000091191.mpg-machine_readable_results.txt</strong><br>
    <br>
    The result sets for each file are separeted by the record separator, in this
    case it is ASCII characters 13 and 10 which is the code that instructs a
    text editor to split the text to separate text lines.<br>
    <br>
    There are now 14 sets of results because the one input file did result in 14
    output files. Note that there was an error processing streams 4 and 6. The
    streams were present in the transport stream, but they had zero audio
    channels.<br>
    <br>
    The values inside the machine readable results file are below. Note that I
    have changed the unit separator character to comma here to make the text
    more human readable :)<br>

    FreeLCS has processed a file that had 3 streams in it. The file is 3 hous 12
    minutes long and first stream is 5.1 audio. The first stream is so big that
    the output file would exeed wav format max size of 4 GB, so FreeLCS did
    split this file to one file per audio channel resulting in 6 output files.<br>

    <h2><a id="MXF_audio_remixing">MXF audio remixing</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You need to install libav-tools for this feature
      to work.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Important note:</strong> This function is not guaranteed to work
      !!!!!!! MXF is not one format, but a family of formats (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Exchange_Format#MXF_in_use">more
        info on Wikipedia</a>). Every hardware and software vendor seem to have
      their own version of MXF. MXF files created with one device might not be
      compatible with a device created by another vendor. Because of this there
      is no guarantee that FreeLCS can process every MXF - file you feed it. It
      is best to do a thorough test with a large set of different MXF files
      before you make this feature part of your workflow. I have limited access
      to MXF files, but I have been able to test some created by Omneon, Carbon,
      Avid, Hamburg MXF4mac and had success with them.</p>
    <p>FreeLCS 2.5 lets you define how you want audio inside an MXF file to be
      recombined before loudness processing. This feature is called MXF audio
      remixing.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h3><a id="The_MXF_Problem">The MXF Problem</a><br>
    </h3>
    <p>Consider an example where video and audio of a program is wrapper inside
      an MXF wrapper. The program has two versions of the audio: a stereo
      version (2 channels) and an 5.1 version (6 channels). Audio might be
      stored inside the MXF wrapper as one 8 channels file (<strong>Example 1</strong>),
      or as 8 separate mono files (<strong>Example 2</strong>).</p>

    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Audio from these files can not be processed with FreeLCS because it has
      no knowledge about which files belong to the same audio version (mix). This
      information can be provided to FreeLCS in the form of a MXF remix map.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="MXF_remix_map">MXF remix map</a></h2>
    <p>A MXF remix map tells FreeLCS how audio channels inside a MXF file must
      be recombined before loudness processing. When a remix map is active then
      FreeLCS first extracts audio from the MXF wrapper and then recombines
      audio channels according to the remix map and writes each resulting mix to
      a separate audio file. Then FreeLCS moves these files to the HotFolder so
      that they go through the normal loudness processing.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h3><a id="Default_MXF_remix_map">Default MXF remix map</a></h3>
    <p> You can define a default remix map during FreeLCS installation. This
      default map is used when there is no other information available about a
      specific MXF file.</p>
    <p>In the picture below the green numbers above the boxes mean the number of
      the mix. The numbers inside the box defines how many audio channels each
      mix has. A total 48 remix parameters can be defined meaning that channel
      inside an MXF file can be recombined to max 48 new audio files. The
      default remix map is all number 2's. This means that if there is no file
      specific MXF remix map found then recombine all audio files found inside a
      MXF to new stereo files.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>If you know all your MXF files have these mixes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Stereo</li>
      <li>5.1</li>
      <li>Stereo</li>
      <li>Stereo</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Then you could define a default channel map of: <strong>2, 6, 2, 2</strong>&nbsp;
      meaning that you put number 2's in boxes 1, 3 and 4 and number 6 in box 2.
      You can have more mix definitions than you have channels inside MXF files,
      only those mixes are created that have enough input channels available.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <img alt="" src="Pictures/MXF_Remixing-01.jpg">
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h3><a id="File_specific_MXF_remix_map">File specific MXF remix map</a></h3>
    <p>In addition to the default remix map the user can use file specific MXF
      remix maps. A file specific remix map overrides the default remix map
      defined during installation. For example if most of your files have the
      same channel configuration, then you would assing this configuration to
      the default MXF remix map during FreeLCS installation. Once in a while you
      might want to process a file that has a channel configuration differing
      from your regular MXF files. In this case you could override the default
      channel configuration only for this file with a file specif remix map.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>A file specific remix map is a simple <strong>text file</strong> that
      has inside it channel counts separated with a comma. The name of the remix
      map file is always the same as the name of the MXF file it is used for
      except the file extension of the original file "<strong>.mxf</strong>" is
      replaced with "<strong>.remix_map</strong>". You can define more mixes
      than you have channels inside MXF files, only those mixes are created that
      have enough input channels available.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    The user wants to extract 4 mixes from a MXF file. These mixes are: <strong>stereo,
      5.1, stereo, stereo</strong>.<br>
    <br>
    MXF file name: <strong>Testfile.mxf</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <br>
    Remix map file name: <strong>Testfile.remix_map</strong><br>
    Contents of the remix map file: <strong>2,6,2,2</strong><br>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>As you can see, it is very easy to use file specific remix maps. You just
      create a text file with the same name as the MXF file it is used for and
      put some numbers in it separeted by commas. The numbers are the channel
      counts for each mix you wan't FreeLCS to recombine before loudness
      processing. </p>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> the file specific remix map must be in
      FreeLCS HotFolder <strong>BEFORE</strong> the MXF arrives there. FreeLCS
      checks once for each MXF file it sees if it can find the corresponding
      file specific remix map, and if it is not found then FreeLCS processes the
      file according to the information it had available then.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="How_channels_are_combined_from_MXF_audio_files">How channels are
        combined from MXF audio files</a></h2>
    <p>I have seen some very peculiar MXF files. One file had several mono audio
      files in it except in between the mono files there was a single stereo
      file. How is FreeLCS supposed to know from which file to take the audio
      channels user has defined in a remix map ? Because of this peculiarity I
      designed FreeLCS to be "blind" to the physical files inside a MXF file,
      FreeLCS only "sees" a bunch of audio channels available to it. It does not
      care which physical file the channel comes from, it just uses channels
      starting from file 1 channel 1 and going to the next file until it finds
      all the channels the user has defined in a remix map.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Example:</strong></p>
    <p>Most MXF files will have single mono files or 8 channel files inside but
      consider this theoretical example. Suppose the channel counts in audio
      files inside a MXF file was: <strong>1, 2, 3, 4</strong> &nbsp; and the
      user defined a channel map of <strong>4, 3, 2, 1</strong>. This example
      clarifies what it means that FreeLCS is "blind" to physical audio files in
      a MXF file and only sees a bunch of audio channels.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Remix map 4</strong>: In this case FreeLCS would first need 4
      channels to fullfill the first item in the remix map the user defined, so
      FreeLCS would take all channels from physical files: 1 and 2 then it would
      need one more channel and it would take the first channel of file 3
      leaving 2 channels unused in this physical file. </p>
    <p><strong>Remix map 3</strong>: The next remix map definition is for 3
      channels, so FreeLCS would then take the 2 channels that were left unused
      in physical file 3 and then 1 channel from physical file 4 leaving 3
      channels unused in this physical file.</p>
    <p><strong>Remix map 2</strong>: The next remix map definition is for 2
      channels and FreeLCS would take channels 2 and 3 that are still unused in
      physical file 4. This would leave 1 unused channel in physical file 4.</p>
    <p><strong>Remix map 1</strong>: Then we only have the last channel left of
      physical file 4 and that would fullfill the last remix map that defines we
      need 1 channels for this mix.<br>
    </p>
