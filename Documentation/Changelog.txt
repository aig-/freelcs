Documentation
--------------
- Added the new window in the installer that lets user select between sample peak and TruePeak measurement.

LoudnessCorrection Version 154
-------------------------------
- Bugfix: Added printing of peak_measurement method In debug - mode. I forgot to do that in the last version :)

installer 038
--------------
- Bugfix: LoudnessCorrection.py was not installed to /usr/bin/ if user after installation navigated back through windows.
- Added the possibility to select between sample peak and TruePeak measurement.

Documentation
--------------
- Added some clarifications to the manual about what happens to the files when they are processed.

LoudnessCorrection Version 153
-------------------------------
- Bugfix: If there were several audiostreams in a file, then the channel count string in the extracted files name was incorrect.
- Bugfix: When setting debug = True, the script crashed due to a critical dictionary not being defined.
- Bugfix: Audio duration was not correctly extrated from ffmpeg output in some cases.
- Added the possibility to use libebur128 TruePeak measurement method to find highest peaks. This is 4 times slower than just finding the sample peaks.
- Protective limiter limits peaks to -4 dBFS when using sample peaks and to -2 dBFS when using TruePeak. In both cases resulting peaks will be about 1 dB higher than the limit.

LoudnessCorrection Version 152
-------------------------------
- Bugfix: Introduced a bug a couple of versions ago when increased the maximum number of audiostreams that are extracted from a file from 8 to unlimited. The bug caused the program to crash when it was processing mp3 - files.
- Bugfix: File duration was displayed incorrectly in the loudness history graphics file if duration was exactly 10 seconds.
- Loudness history graphics display is calculated with 0.5 sec resolution if file duration is under 12 seconds (was previously for files less than 10 seconds). Resolution for longer files is 3 seconds.

HeartBeat_Checker version 015
-------------------------------
- HeartBeat_Checker now reads LoudnessCorrection IP-Addresses from the heartbeat.pickle instead of getting the addresses from the os. If HeartBeat_Checker and LoudnessCorrection are running on separate machines then emailed error messages nwo correctly tell IP-Addresses of the LoudnessCorrection - machine.

LoudnessCorrection Version 151
-------------------------------
- The script now writes the machines IP-Addresses to the pickle HeartBeat_Checker monitors.
- Made some small modifications to error email formatting.

installer 034
--------------
