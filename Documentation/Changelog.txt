LoudnessCorrection Version 169
-------------------------------
- Found a way to skip creating an intermediate file when the output file size is over 4 GB and needs to be split to separate channels. Speeds things up a bit in these cases.
- Cleaned up sox routines by splitting repeating sections to separate subroutines.
- Bugfix: integrated loudness calculation routine mixed english and finnish in error messages.

LoudnessCorrection Version 168
-------------------------------
- Moved a functionality to it's own subroutine: get_audiofile_info_with_sox_and_determine_ouput_format
- If output file size would exeed wav format max size of 4 GB, and the file is split to separate mono files or stored as a flac file then print a warning message about this in the loudness history graphics file.

LoudnessCorrection Version 167
-------------------------------
- Bugfix: Corrected some bugs in 4 GB limit workaround. 

LoudnessCorrection Version 165
-------------------------------
- Workaround for wav 4 GB size limit is ready but untested. If outputfile will be bigger than 4 GB (for example a long 5.1 file), the channels in the file will be split to separate mono files. If individual mono files would still exeed the 4 GB wav limit, then all channels of the file are written to a single flac file.

LoudnessCorrection Version 164
-------------------------------
- Took another approach to the 4 GB wav file size limit problem and undid some work done in version 163.
- Latest version of Sox (14.4.2) seems to have implemented wav size support over 4 GB limit, but it's still buggy. Wav header gets messed up when 4 GB limit is exceeded. I filed a bugreport here: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3558019&group_id=10706&atid=110706

LoudnessCorrection Version 163
-------------------------------
- Bugfix: By mistake used a wrong Python method to find channel count and other numeric audio information from FFmpeg output. Corrected.
- Started initial work on a problem when processing very large files would cause output file size to exceed wav-format max size of 4 GB.

Documentation
--------------
- Added info about how to download unreleased development versions of the software.

HeartBeat_Checker version 018
-------------------------------
- Bugfix: HeartBeat Checker adds the time when an error happened to the email it sends to admin. The time was not always correct.
- HeartBeat Checker now adds Heartbeat Checker and LoudnessCorrection program version numbers and other additional program info to emails it sends to the admin.

LoudnessCorrection Version 162
-------------------------------
- LoudnessCorrection now adds its version number to the timestamp-file that HeartBeat_Checker monitors.

LoudnessCorrection Version 161
-------------------------------
- All FFmpeg output parsing is now in its own subroutine and easier to change when new needs arise.
- Bugfix: it seems that transport streams can have audio streams with a channel count of 0 which is quite surprising. These dummy streams are now skipped.
- Bugfix: corrected another instance of a bug corrected in 159, when FFmpeg output contained characters that could not be translated to UTF-8 and caused a crash. Now ISO-8859-15 is used in these cases.
- Corrected variable name: 'peak_measuring_method' to 'peak_measurement_method'.
- LoudnessCOrrection now writes its version number to the timestamps file that HeartBeat_Checker monitors.

installer 039
--------------
- Corrected variable name: 'peak_measuring_method' to 'peak_measurement_method'.

LoudnessCorrection Version 160
-------------------------------
- Audio stream information is found out using FFmpeg. FFmpeg output parsing is split into two parts in the program. Started to move all FFmpeg output parsing to its own subroutine: get_audio_stream_information_with_ffmpeg. 

LoudnessCorrection Version 159
-------------------------------
- Added an check for if FFmpeg extracted stream number is valid.
- Bugfix: Fixed a crash that happened when a file was inspected with FFmpeg and it output info (transportstream metadata) that contained characters that could not be translated to UTF-8. In these cases ISO-8859-15 is now used.
- Bugfix: FFmpeg output format changes slightly depending what stream info it finds. Stream map numbers were not always found.

LoudnessCorrection Version 158
-------------------------------
- Bugfix: If a file has many audiostreams then FFmpeg sometimes extracts the streams in random order and stream numbers and channel counts in filenames won't match. The FFmpeg stream number is now extracted from FFmpeg output and mapping is used to extract the streams in the correct order. 

LoudnessCorrection Version 157
-------------------------------
- Corrected some copy / paste errors that was left when doing the modifications in version 155.

LoudnessCorrection Version 155
-------------------------------
- Hunted a hanging bug that sometimes manifests itself when processing lots of very short files (duration 1 second). I changed all instances of subprocess.Popen to use real files as the stdout and stderr buffers for the external commands that are run through subprocess.Popen. Some sources on the net said this is safer in threading than using subprocess.PIPE. In the end I found that the hanging bug is not in LoudnessCorrection.py but in libebur128 program 'loudness'. I have made the developer aware of this problem by filing a bugreport here: https://github.com/jiixyj/libebur128/issues/14

- Corrected some typos and made minor clarifications.
- Corrected an error in the command needed to install required packages. The requirements was missing idle3.
- Added info about how to report bugs and get error messages from the programs.

Documentation
--------------
- Added the new window in the installer that lets user select between sample peak and TruePeak measurement.

LoudnessCorrection Version 154
-------------------------------
- Bugfix: Added printing of peak_measurement method In debug - mode. I forgot to do that in the last version :)

installer 038
--------------
- Bugfix: LoudnessCorrection.py was not installed to /usr/bin/ if user after installation navigated back through windows.
- Added the possibility to select between sample peak and TruePeak measurement.

Documentation
--------------
- Added some clarifications to the manual about what happens to the files when they are processed.

LoudnessCorrection Version 153
-------------------------------
- Bugfix: If there were several audiostreams in a file, then the channel count string in the extracted files name was incorrect.
- Bugfix: When setting debug = True, the script crashed due to a critical dictionary not being defined.
- Bugfix: Audio duration was not correctly extrated from ffmpeg output in some cases.
- Added the possibility to use libebur128 TruePeak measurement method to find highest peaks. This is 4 times slower than just finding the sample peaks.
- Protective limiter limits peaks to -4 dBFS when using sample peaks and to -2 dBFS when using TruePeak. In both cases resulting peaks will be about 1 dB higher than the limit.

LoudnessCorrection Version 152
-------------------------------
- Bugfix: Introduced a bug a couple of versions ago when increased the maximum number of audiostreams that are extracted from a file from 8 to unlimited. The bug caused the program to crash when it was processing mp3 - files.
- Bugfix: File duration was displayed incorrectly in the loudness history graphics file if duration was exactly 10 seconds.
- Loudness history graphics display is calculated with 0.5 sec resolution if file duration is under 12 seconds (was previously for files less than 10 seconds). Resolution for longer files is 3 seconds.

HeartBeat_Checker version 017
-------------------------------
The first email (HeartBeat_Checker has started) was sent too early, before the timestamps and other info of LoudnessCorrection was read.

installer 037
--------------
- Bugfix: Some directory permissions were not set correctly if HeartBeat Checker was deselected in installer.

installer 035
--------------
- Bugfix: Installer let the user go to the next window even though loudnesscorrection_init_script was not installed yet.
- Bigfix: Some directory ownership and permissions were not set correctly if the user selected not to create a ram disk.

HeartBeat_Checker version 015
-------------------------------
- HeartBeat_Checker now reads LoudnessCorrection IP-Addresses from the heartbeat.pickle instead of getting the addresses from the os. If HeartBeat_Checker and LoudnessCorrection are running on separate machines then emailed error messages nwo correctly tell IP-Addresses of the LoudnessCorrection - machine.

LoudnessCorrection Version 151
-------------------------------
- The script now writes the machines IP-Addresses to the pickle HeartBeat_Checker monitors.
- Made some small modifications to error email formatting.

installer 034
--------------
- Bugfix: Samba mount path was always 'LoudnessCorrection', changed this to follow the selected language. The mount path when finnish is selected is now 'AanekkyysKorjaus'.
