HeartBeat_Checker version 015
-------------------------------
- HeartBeat_Checker now reads LoudnessCorrection IP-Addresses from the heartbeat.pickle instead of getting the addresses from the os. If HeartBeat_Checker and LoudnessCorrection are running on separate machines then emailed error messages nwo correctly tell IP-Addresses of the LoudnessCorrection - machine.

LoudnessCorrection Version 151
-------------------------------
- The script now writes the machines IP-Addresses to the pickle HeartBeat_Checker monitors.
- Made some small modifications to error email formatting.
