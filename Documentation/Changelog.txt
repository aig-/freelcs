LoudnessCorrection Version 152
-------------------------------
- Bugfix: Introduced a bug a couple of versions ago when increased the maximum number of audiostreams that are extracted from a file from 8 to unlimited. The bug caused the program to crash when it was processing mp3 - files.
- Bugfix: File duration was displayed incorrectly in the loudness history graphics file if duration was exactly 10 seconds.
- Loudness history graphics display is calculated with 0.5 sec resolution if file duration is under 12 seconds (was previously for files less than 10 seconds). Resolution for longer files is 3 seconds.

Documentation
--------------
- Added documentation for FreeLCS 1.0 :)

HeartBeat_Checker version 015
-------------------------------

If HeartBeat_Checker and LoudnessCorrection are running on separate machines then emailed error messages nwo correctly tell IP-Addresses of the LoudnessCorrection - machine.

LoudnessCorrection Version 151
-------------------------------
- The script now writes the machines IP-Addresses to the pickle HeartBeat_Checker monitors.
- Made some small modifications to error email formatting.

installer 034
--------------
- Bugfix: Samba mount path was always 'LoudnessCorrection', changed this to follow the selected language. The mount path when finnish is selected is now 'AanekkyysKorjaus'.
